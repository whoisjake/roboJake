A simple roomba and netbook based robot, as a simple hardware

Ruby 1.8.7 (gems: ruby-osc, eventmachine, serialport)
Virtual Serial Port (USB) Driver

Optional: iOSC or another OSC controller

Through TCP interface

Connect to your roomba via telnet:
telnet <Roomba Netbook IP> 6060

The following commands are available:
forward <seconds>
fast_forward <seconds>
backwards <seconds>
turn_left
nudge_left
turn_right
nudge_right
turn_around
beep
honk
stop

Through OSC interface

This works with any standard, configurable OSC interface!

Such as: iOSC (iPhone)

Map the following urls to buttons, requires no arguments:
"/bot/stop"
"/bot/forward"
"/bot/backwards"
"/bot/turn/left"
"/bot/turn/right"
"/bot/turn/around"
"/bot/honk"

Each one should work on the button "down" event, with the "/bot/stop"
being wired to the button "up" event to stop movement.
